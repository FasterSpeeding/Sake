# Sake

A distributed asynchronous cache interface (plus several implementations) designed for use with Hikari.

# Installation

You can install Sake from PyPI using the following command.

```
python -m pip install hikari-sake -U
```

The `hikari-sake[tanjun]` feature flag can be used to ensure that the installed Tanjun version
is compatible with Sake's Tanjun adapters. You should still have a Tanjun version pinned in
your own requirements as this just provides an acceptable range for the requirement.

# Support

# Quick Usage.
